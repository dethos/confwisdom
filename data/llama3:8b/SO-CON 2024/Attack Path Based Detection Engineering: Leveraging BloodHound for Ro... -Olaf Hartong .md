**SUMMARY**
A speaker discusses their experience using APIs for logging on and off devices, mentioning tools like Sentinel and Defender. They share limitations of local logons and mention the importance of time-outs.

**IDEAS:**
• The speaker uses APIs to track device logon events, including 4624 events.
• Sentinel and Defender are used for logging on and off devices.
• Local logons have limitations when using Sentinel or other tools.
• Time-outs are important to prevent activity from continuing after a certain period.
• Defender has a device information table that shows currently logged-on users.
• The speaker uses Log Analytics SDK or Defender APIs, which are fully supported.
• Disabling time-out actions is an option if there's still activity.
• Path calculations can affect performance and require careful planning.

**INSIGHTS:**
• Using APIs for logging on and off devices provides valuable insights into device activity.
• Sentinel and Defender offer more capabilities than local logons alone.
• Time-outs are essential to prevent ongoing activity after a certain period.
• The device information table in Defender provides additional context about logged-on users.
• Fully supported APIs like Log Analytics SDK or Defender provide reliable data.

**QUOTES:**
• "Yeah yeah I haven't needed that yet but at some point it's actually a cool idea to get some additional stuff that you can't get from uh other information sources generally."
• "It will over only updat stuff that is older um so the time out you have a time set for days after and session no no because probably it's likely that there's still activity..."

**HABITS:**
• The speaker uses Log Analytics SDK or Defender APIs, which are fully supported.
• They mention the importance of carefully planning path calculations to avoid performance issues.

**FACTS:**
• Device logon events can be tracked using APIs like Sentinel and Defender.
• Local logons have limitations when using these tools.
• Time-outs are important to prevent ongoing activity after a certain period.

**REFERENCES:**
• Sentinel
• Defender
• Log Analytics SDK

**ONE-SENTENCE TAKEAWAY:**
Using APIs for logging on and off devices provides valuable insights into device activity, highlighting the importance of time-outs and careful planning for path calculations.

**RECOMMENDATIONS:**
• Use fully supported APIs like Log Analytics SDK or Defender to track device logon events.
• Plan carefully for path calculations to avoid performance issues.
• Consider disabling time-out actions if there's still ongoing activity.
