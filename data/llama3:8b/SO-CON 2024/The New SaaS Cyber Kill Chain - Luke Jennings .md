**SUMMARY**
A researcher discusses a new threat landscape where attackers are using privileged actions to move laterally and gain access to sensitive data. The presentation covers techniques used by red teams and real-world attacks, including MFA hijacking.

**IDEAS:**
* Attackers can use privileged actions to move laterally and gain access to sensitive data.
* Red teams and threat actors are now exploring this space and adapting their tactics.
* There is a lack of support for advanced controls like UB keys in many SaaS apps.
* Many SaaS apps do not support Single Sign-On (SSO) or require additional payment.
* Attackers can register new MFA devices to gain persistent access to accounts.
* Attackers can use session control and add new MFA methods to log back in without password theft.
* The space is ripe for further research, including new techniques and tooling.

**INSIGHTS:**
* The threat landscape is evolving rapidly, with attackers adapting to new technologies.
* Advanced controls are not widely supported in SaaS apps, making it easier for attackers to move laterally.
* MFA hijacking is a common tactic used by attackers to gain persistent access to accounts.
* Red teams and blue teams need better tooling and techniques to stay ahead of attackers.

**QUOTES:**
* "Attackers can use privileged actions to move laterally and gain access to sensitive data."
* "There is a huge amount of scope for other researchers to jump in and come up with new techniques or expand out the existing ones."

**HABITS:**
* None mentioned in this presentation.

**FACTS:**
* Many SaaS apps do not support Single Sign-On (SSO) or require additional payment.
* Attackers can register new MFA devices to gain persistent access to accounts.

**REFERENCES:**
* None mentioned in this presentation.

**ONE-SENTENCE TAKEAWAY**
The threat landscape is evolving rapidly, with attackers adapting to new technologies and using privileged actions to move laterally and gain access to sensitive data.

**RECOMMENDATIONS:**
* Conduct further research on new techniques and tooling for red teams and blue teams.
* Develop better support for advanced controls like UB keys in SaaS apps.
* Improve MFA security by implementing more robust session control and logging.
