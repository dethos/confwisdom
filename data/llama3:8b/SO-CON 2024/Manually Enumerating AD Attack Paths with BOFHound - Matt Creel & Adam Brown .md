**SUMMARY**
A talk about BloodHound Community Edition's API and its potential uses in pentesting and red teaming. The presenter discusses the challenges of processing large amounts of LDAP data and mentions plans to improve the tool's memory consumption and add support for Active Directory Certificate Services.

**IDEAS:**

* Elap enumeration is a powerful technique for discovering attack paths, but it requires manual processing.
* BloodHound Community Edition has an API that can be used to upload data and create seamless integration with other tools.
* The API can be used to build relationships between objects in memory and then upload them to the web interface.
* Running LDAP queries against large datasets can be time-consuming and may not scale well.
* Using a temporary on-disk database or direct interaction with the BC API could improve performance.

**INSIGHTS:**

* The key to successful pentesting is finding the right balance between stealth and speed.
* BloodHound's API has the potential to revolutionize the way we approach red teaming and pentesting.
* Improving memory consumption and adding support for Active Directory Certificate Services are crucial steps in making BloodHound a more powerful tool.

**QUOTES:**

* "You don't have to worry about stealth when performing elap enumeration..."
* "...if you're doing a pen test this is probably something you don't have to worry about even on a red team..."

**ONE-SENTENCE TAKEAWAY**
The future of pentesting and red teaming relies on finding a balance between stealth and speed, made possible by powerful tools like BloodHound's API.

**RECOMMENDATIONS:**

* Implement the BC API to improve data processing and integration.
* Use temporary on-disk databases or direct interaction with the BC API to reduce memory consumption.
* Prioritize adding support for Active Directory Certificate Services in future updates.
