**SUMMARY**
Justin presenting on Blood Hound Enterprise features and priorities for the next year, including graph expansion, reporting, and attack path primitives.

**IDEAS:**
* Brain-melted all day with Community or Enterprise product
* Start by seeing the long-term future look like at least this year
* Three main priorities for the next year: give back to customers, continue graph expansion, and go faster for both community and enterprise development
* Further granularity in attack paths that we expose reporting letting you know of an issue without having to log in
* Continued graph expansion from adcs, introducing more escalations beyond what will and Lee originally found
* Potential support adding even more hybrid paths
* Removing design decisions that added friction to enable further graph like attack path primitive development

**INSIGHTS:**
* The Blood Hound Community side allowed for faster development for both community and enterprise
* Graph expansion is a key priority, with adcs being the gift that keeps on giving
* Further granularity in attack paths will allow for better reporting and issue detection
* Removing friction will enable the team to go faster and make it easier for others to contribute

**QUOTES:**
* "we don't show you where those connections are" (referring to active directory and Azure data)
* "make it a hard decision on whether you want to uh contribute to Blood Hound or you know build your own thing"

**HABITS:**
* No specific habits mentioned by the speaker

**FACTS:**
* None specifically mentioned, but adcs is referred to as introducing more escalations beyond what will and Lee originally found

**REFERENCES:**
* Cub Hound
* Falcon for stuff that Olaf was doing with Falcon Hound

**ONE-SENTENCE TAKEAWAY**
The Blood Hound Enterprise features will prioritize giving back to customers, continuing graph expansion, and going faster for both community and enterprise development.

**RECOMMENDATIONS:**
* Start by seeing the long-term future look like at least this year
* Prioritize further granularity in attack paths that we expose reporting letting you know of an issue without having to log in
* Consider removing design decisions that added friction to enable further graph like attack path primitive development
