**SUMMARY**
Will Pierce and Nick Land discuss using large language models (LLMs) for their primary intention of building a model to quantify outputs of findings based on contextual knowledge of their environment. They emphasize the importance of providing constraints around the model and embedding imparting knowledge.

**IDEAS:**

1. Zero-shot prompting with big LLMs can be challenging, but recent research shows promising results in fine-tuning models.
2. Providing constraints around the model is crucial for achieving desired outputs.
3. Embedding imparting knowledge on the model helps refine its performance.
4. Large language models are not a silver bullet; they require experimentation and iteration to achieve desired results.
5. Fine-tuning models can be an effective way to improve their performance.
6. The process of building a solution involves experimentation, not just pulling something off the shelf.
7. Providing metrics for success is essential in evaluating model performance.
8. Large language models are not meant to replace human judgment but rather augment it.

**INSIGHTS:**

1. Building a solution with large language models requires experimentation and iteration.
2. Fine-tuning models can be an effective way to improve their performance.
3. Providing constraints around the model is crucial for achieving desired outputs.
4. Embedding imparting knowledge on the model helps refine its performance.
5. Large language models are not a silver bullet; they require experimentation and iteration to achieve desired results.

**QUOTES:**

1. "You don't want a gigantic narrative, you just want it to say 'Hey, here's this form, please fill out this form.'"
2. "The process is like embedding imparting your knowledge on the model and putting constraints around it about what you want to see."

**HABITS:**

1. Providing clear metrics for success.
2. Experimenting with different approaches to achieve desired results.

**FACTS:**

1. Recent research shows promising results in fine-tuning large language models.

**REFERENCES:**
