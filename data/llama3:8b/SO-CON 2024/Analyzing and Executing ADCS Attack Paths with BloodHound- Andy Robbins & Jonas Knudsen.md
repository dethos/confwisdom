**SUMMARY**
Hope This Is Us presents their architecture for processing non-traversable edges into traversable edges in Bloodhound. The discussion covers data ingestion, reconciliation, and post-processing steps.

**IDEAS:**
• Data is ingested into Bloodhound as a JSON-formatted file.
• Ingestion involves naive and generic mapping of JSON properties to variables.
• Reconciliation process compares new information with existing database contents.
• Post-processing creates non-traversable edges and nodes in the database.
• Published 2 edges are created during ingestion, while escalation one edges are created later.
• Advanced logic is used to find intersection points between principles and certificate templates.

**INSIGHTS:**
• The reconciliation process ensures that the model reflects the most up-to-date information.
• Post-processing creates non-traversable edges and nodes in the database.
• Published 2 edges are created during ingestion, while escalation one edges are created later through complex logic.
• The architecture involves multiple steps to transform non-traversable edges into traversable ones.

**QUOTES:**
• "Naive" - referring to the ingest process
• "Generic" - describing the JSON property mapping

**HABITS:** (None)

**FACTS:** (None)

**ONE-SENTENCE TAKEAWAY**
The Bloodhound architecture involves multiple steps to transform non-traversable edges into traversable ones, ensuring a comprehensive and up-to-date model.

**RECOMMENDATIONS:**
• Implement a robust reconciliation process to ensure data consistency.
• Use advanced logic to create escalation one edges and published 2 edges efficiently.
