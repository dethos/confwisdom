**SUMMARY**
A presentation on exploiting authentication packages in Windows, including DPAPI and LSASS. The presenter discusses various techniques for gaining access to sensitive data and credentials.

**IDEAS:**
* Impacket can be used to make a request for an MSV1 response to complete authentication.
* The add package component in Elsas allows for the addition of new packages.
* Microsoft's new authentication scheme, I-Curb, may offer a brand new authentication package.
* Authentication packages can be used to log on a user and create a new session.
* LSASS memory access allows for the recovery of sensitive data and credentials.

* Impacket can be used to make a request for an MSV1 response to complete authentication.
* Elsas has many calls that can be used for host enumeration.
* Authentication packages can be used to recover single sign-on cookies and DPAPI keys.
* LSASS memory access allows for the recovery of sensitive data and credentials.
* Impacket's NLM relay feature can be used to modify responses.

**INSIGHTS:**
* Authentication packages in Windows offer a way to gain access to sensitive data and credentials.
* The add package component in Elsas is useful for facilitating new authentication schemes.
* LSASS memory access allows for the recovery of sensitive data and credentials, even with mitigations enabled.
* Impacket can be used to make requests to authentication packages and complete authentication.

**QUOTES:**
* "Jump Right In" - an invitation to explore Windows authentication packages
* No specific quotes mentioned

**HABITS:**
* None mentioned in the presentation

**FACTS:**
* Microsoft has implemented a new authentication scheme, I-Curb.
* DPAPI keys can be used to decrypt master key files.
* NLM responses can be modified using Impacket's relay feature.

**REFERENCES:**
* Impacket (a command-line tool for Windows)

**ONE-SENTENCE TAKEAWAY**
Windows authentication packages offer a way to gain access to sensitive data and credentials, even with mitigations enabled.

**RECOMMENDATIONS:**
* Explore Windows authentication packages using tools like Impacket.
* Use the add package component in Elsas to facilitate new authentication schemes.
* Leverage LSASS memory access to recover sensitive data and credentials.
