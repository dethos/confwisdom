Here is the extracted information in Markdown format:

**SUMMARY**
A developer discusses their experience building two packages, Jungle and Jungle Rest Testing, which aim to improve the developer experience by providing a composable approach to defining endpoints and testing. The speaker shares their insights on the challenges they faced and the lessons learned during the development process.

**IDEAS:**
• Creating reusable components for views is crucial for improving the developer experience.
• The API view class should be designed to accommodate various request methods, including GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.
• Defining inner view functions can simplify the process of creating repetitive operations.
• Using a single test object can help reduce the complexity of testing scenarios.
• The scenario approach can abstract away the need for HTTP calls and client usage, making it easier to manage tests.

**INSIGHTS:**
• Improving the developer experience requires a focus on creating reusable components and simplifying complex processes.
• Effective testing strategies involve reducing complexity by using single test objects and scenario approaches.
• Designing API view classes with flexibility in mind can help accommodate different request methods.
• Continuous learning and improvement are essential for developers to stay up-to-date with the latest technologies.

**QUOTES:**
• "Thank you, thank you, thank you... um yeah so let's start uh as you said uh it's time consuming to do all of those uh the two packages the maintenance and the think about the features..."
• "...it was really hard and time-consuming even though it's a very valuable learning experience..."

**HABITS:**
• Developing reusable components for views.
• Simplifying complex processes through inner view functions.
• Using scenario approaches for testing.
• Designing API view classes with flexibility in mind.

**FACTS:**
• The Jungle package aims to improve the developer experience by providing a composable approach to defining endpoints.
• The Jungle Rest Testing package focuses on simplifying the process of testing scenarios.
