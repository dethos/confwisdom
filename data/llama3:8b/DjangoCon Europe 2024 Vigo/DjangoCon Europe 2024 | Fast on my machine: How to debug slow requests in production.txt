SUMMARY:
Rafael, a speaker, discusses performance issues in software applications and introduces various tools to identify and optimize bottlenecks. He presents his experience in using PG stat statements, postgreSQL extension, and Sentry for proactive performance data collection.

IDEAS:
• Long-running queries can cause performance issues in databases.
• Optimizing database queries requires knowledge of the codebase.
• PG stat statements provide statistics on running queries and their durations.
• Pspy is a sampling profiler that attaches to a running process without restarting it.
• Jango applications often have constant memory profiles once running.
• CPU power is usually the bottleneck in Jango applications.
• Caching can be used to optimize performance issues.
• Profilers, such as ppy, help identify bottlenecks and optimize code.

INSIGHTS:
• Performance optimization requires a deep understanding of the application's codebase.
• Long-running queries can cause significant slowdowns in databases.
• Profiling tools can help identify and prioritize optimization efforts.
• Caching can be an effective way to reduce query execution times.
• Jango applications often benefit from CPU optimization.

QUOTES:
• "Usually, it is not a problem with our code or not one specific problem we can easily find and fix."
• "My favorite one for a number of years is ppy. Unlike C profile which runs in the python process..."
• "PG stat statements of postgreSQL extension that can collect statistics about which queres are running how often..."

HABITS:
• Rafael emphasizes the importance of knowing your codebase well to optimize performance.
• He uses profilers like Pspy to identify bottlenecks and optimize code.

FACTS:
• Jango applications usually don't leak memory too much once running.
• CPU power is rarely the issue in Jango applications.
• Network bandwidth is occasionally a bottleneck in software applications.

REFERENCES:
• PG stat statements
• postgreSQL extension
• Sentry
• Pspy

ONE-SENTENCE TAKEAWAY:
To optimize performance, developers must understand their codebase and use profiling tools to identify bottlenecks.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
• Use profiling tools like Pspy to identify and prioritize optimization efforts.
• Optimize database queries to reduce query execution times.
• Implement caching to reduce the load on databases.
• Prioritize CPU optimization in Jango applications.
