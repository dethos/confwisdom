**SUMMARY**
A speaker discusses a solution to a problem with a regular expression (regex) in Jango. They present a clever solution that replaces the problematic regex with a handwritten search and uses a class of their own to match Open Brackets or words, achieving 20,000 times faster computation.

**IDEAS:**

* Regexes can be complex and time-consuming for machines.
* The main branch was not affected by the problem code in Jango.
* A rewritten regex can introduce subtle behavior changes.
* It's important to limit and localize changes in stable branches.
* Handwritten search classes can be used as a solution.
* Google introduced a library called re2 that implements regexes with parallel states.
* This library doesn't support assertions but has guaranteed linear time.

**INSIGHTS:**

* Complex regexes can lead to slow computation times.
* It's crucial to consider the impact of changes on stable branches.
* Handwritten search classes can be a viable solution for specific problems.
* Linear time algorithms are not always the fastest, but they're never catastrophic.
* Libraries like re2 can help implement regexes efficiently.

**QUOTES:**

* "A Hebrew proverb characterizes the clever as those who know how to get out of trouble when the wise know better than to step into it in the first place."

**ONE-SENTENCE TAKEAWAY**
To achieve efficient computation, consider replacing complex regexes with handwritten search classes or libraries that implement regexes efficiently.

**RECOMMENDATIONS:**

* Use a library like re2 to implement regexes efficiently.
* Consider rewriting complex regexes for specific problems.
* Handwritten search classes can be a viable solution in certain cases.
* Linear time algorithms are not always the fastest, but they're never catastrophic.
