**SUMMARY**
Mia is presenting a topic about using an array to store data instead of persisting it into a database, and how to set up integration tests. She also discusses the benefits and challenges of this setup and recommends using frameworks like Django and Fast API.

**IDEAS:**
• Using arrays to store data can simplify testing and development.
• Integration tests can be set up to test all endpoints in an application.
• Django is opinionated and promotes specific approaches to web development, while Fast API is flexible.
• A module-based structure can work well for bigger projects.
• Experimenting with different frameworks can lead to a deeper understanding of how they work.

**INSIGHTS:**
• Using arrays as a temporary storage solution can simplify testing and development.
• Integration tests are essential for ensuring the stability and reliability of an application.
• Choosing the right framework depends on project requirements and personal preferences.
• Experimenting with different frameworks can lead to new insights and learning opportunities.
• A module-based structure can provide predictability and extensibility in larger projects.

**QUOTES:**
• "It's crazy but it works."
