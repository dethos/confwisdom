SUMMARY
Speaker: unknown
Content: discussion on layered architecture and its challenges, including import L configuration, ignore checks, and domain-driven design.

IDEAS:
* The speaker's team wants to improve their tooling by having real closed layers instead of open layers.
* They feel like they are playing against Jengo as it makes things easier but they tend to compromise.
* Domain-driven design is difficult for the team to follow within their current Ural style.
* The team wants to have clear contracts within the layers vertically and between layers, which is an open problem.
* The speaker's team uses a layered architecture to facilitate collaboration, modularity, clear separation of concerns, defined interfaces, and standardization.

INSIGHTS:
* A layered architecture can promote modularity, clear separation of concerns, and standardization across a code base.
* Having real closed layers instead of open layers can improve tooling.
* Domain-driven design can be challenging to implement within a specific architecture style.
* Clear contracts are essential between layers in a layered architecture.

QUOTES:
* "We want to implement uh is having uh real closed layers instead of uh open layers."
* "Jango makes things so much easier that we tend to compromise."
* "Before questions if if you want to uh uh take one of those lovely Kracken plushes home and to ask more questions uh you can find me in our boot uh I can answer those questions uh in person right after our uh for these plushies."

HABITS:
* No specific habits mentioned by the speaker.

FACTS:
* No specific facts about the greater world mentioned by the speaker.

REFERENCES:
* No specific references to writing, art, tools, or projects mentioned by the speaker.

ONE-SENTENCE TAKEAWAY
The speaker's team uses a layered architecture to facilitate collaboration and modularity in their code base.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
* Implement real closed layers instead of open layers.
* Follow domain-driven design principles within your architecture style.
* Establish clear contracts between layers in your layered architecture.
