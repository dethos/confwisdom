SUMMARY:

Emma is presenting about her experience with Python in Django. She discusses models, fields, and schema adapters, highlighting features such as checkbox options for hiding/showing code and documenting non-app modules.

IDEAS:

* Jango's PK (primary key) is hidden by default
* Django has a feature called Fields which are separate from the model definition
* The "hide/show" checkbox allows users to customize their output
* Emma's tool generates HTML documentation files on the hard drive, not served by the Django server
* Users can access this documentation even if the development server is crashed
