**SUMMARY**
A speaker presents on deploying Django applications and managing CSS files during rolling updates. The talk discusses two solutions: hosting files externally using S3 or a proxy, and using White Noise middleware to serve static assets directly from the Python application.

**IDEAS:**
* Deploying Django applications requires careful management of CSS files during rolling updates.
* Hosting files externally using S3 or a proxy can solve issues with broken applications.
* White Noise middleware can serve static assets directly from the Python application, reducing complexity.
* A small percentage of cases may require proxy-level solutions to avoid loading non-existent files.
* Proxies can manage file management and caching, simplifying deployment processes.
* The speaker highlights the importance of careful planning and migration strategies for growing applications.
* Django's tooling provides nice features, but as applications grow, more advanced management is required.

**INSIGHTS:**
* Deployment requires a balance between simplicity and complexity, with a focus on manageability.
* Proxies can be used to cache and serve static assets, reducing load times and improving performance.
* Careful planning and testing are essential for successful rolling updates and minimizing downtime.
* Django's tooling provides a solid foundation, but advanced management techniques are necessary as applications grow.

**QUOTES:**
* "We love Jango, Jango is amazing."
* "When our application starts to grow we have to make sure that we do all those things carefully..."
* "We have very nice Tooling in Dango..."

**HABITS:**
* No specific habits mentioned by the speaker.

**FACTS:**
* None mentioned by the speaker.

**ONE-SENTENCE TAKEAWAY**
When deploying Django applications, careful planning and management of CSS files during rolling updates are crucial to minimize downtime and ensure smooth transitions.

**RECOMMENDATIONS:**
* Use a proxy or external hosting solution to manage file updates and caching.
* Leverage White Noise middleware to serve static assets directly from the Python application.
* Plan and test carefully to minimize downtime and ensure successful rolling updates.
