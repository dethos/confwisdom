**SUMMARY**
Adam Johnson presents on "Talk Data Oriented Django" at an unknown event, discussing caching and data-oriented design concepts in Django.

**IDEAS:**

* Caching can help reduce repetition in code and improve performance.
* Meta-data analysis can provide valuable insights into system behavior.
* IDE or print statements can be used to collect data about system behavior.
* Production logs and APM tools can also provide insights into production environment.
* Cache tools library provides ways of caching inside Python processes with timeouts.

**INSIGHTS:**

* Data-oriented design is a powerful technique for reducing repetition in code.
* Caching can help improve performance by avoiding unnecessary database queries.
* Meta-data analysis can provide valuable insights into system behavior and help optimize it.
* IDE or print statements can be used to collect data about system behavior, but may not provide actionable insights.

**QUOTES:**

* "Caching as I showed you is a powerful technique for when there is repetition that's likely."
* "If I'd seen this I would have but it was better to look at the actual values and so that's what the cache really helps with."

**HABITS:**

* Collecting data about system behavior through meta-data analysis or IDE/print statements.
* Using caching techniques to improve performance.
* Analyzing production logs and APM tools to gain insights into production environment.

**FACTS:**

* Django has a built-in caching framework for storing values in a separate cache server next to the server.
* HTTP caching can also be used to store data on the user's web browser.

**REFERENCES:**

* None mentioned in the input content.

**ONE-SENTENCE TAKEAWAY**
Data-oriented design and caching are powerful techniques for reducing repetition and improving performance in Django code.

**RECOMMENDATIONS:**

* Use caching to reduce database queries and improve performance.
* Analyze meta-data and production logs to gain insights into system behavior.
* Implement data-oriented design principles to reduce repetition in code.
