Here is the extracted information in Markdown format:

**SUMMARY**
M Shakov presents a talk about prototype pollution and its exploitation. He discusses fixed and unfixed cases, using merge functions as an example.

**IDEAS:**
• Prototype pollution can be found in many applications, including popular packages like Lash.
• Merge functions can pollute the prototype with a payload.
• Different features in an application can be unrelated to each other.
• Fixed prototype pollution cases are exploitable and can lead to remote code execution.
• Don't give up on finding vulnerabilities; even seemingly impossible cases can be exploited.
• The papers "Silence Print Jun" and "Dino" provide further information on prototype pollution research.

**INSIGHTS:**
• Prototype pollution can occur in merge functions, which are commonly used in applications.
• Unfixed cases of prototype pollution can lead to remote code execution.
• Different features in an application can be unrelated to each other.
• Even seemingly impossible cases of vulnerability exploitation can be achieved.
• The importance of persistence and not giving up on finding vulnerabilities.

**QUOTES:**
• "Don't give up try to achieve remote code execution even it looks um unpossible"

**HABITS:**

**ONE-SENTENCE TAKEAWAY**
Don't give up on finding vulnerabilities, even seemingly impossible cases can be exploited.

**RECOMMENDATIONS:**
• Check out the papers "Silence Print Jun" and "Dino" for further information on prototype pollution research.
• Read the blog post "ARP spoofing in kubernetes not so easy as looks like" for insights on networking attacks.
