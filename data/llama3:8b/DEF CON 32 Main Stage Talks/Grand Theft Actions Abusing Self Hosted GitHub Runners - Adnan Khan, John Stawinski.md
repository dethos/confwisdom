**SUMMARY**
A bug bounty presentation by an unknown speaker at Defcon, discussing critical vulnerabilities in various high-end technologies and platforms, including GI up actions, Microsoft, PyTorch, TensorFlow, and more, with a focus on internal cicd security and the importance of learning about these attacks to protect against compromise.

**IDEAS**
• The bug bounty submissions included over 20 high-end critical vulnerability reports.
• Red team engagements can access cicd platforms and escalate privileges to reach objectives.
• Internal cicd security is a nightmare, with everyone vulnerable and compromising these platforms giving extensive privileges.
• Lack of awareness is the main issue in public cic security and internal cicd security.
• Learning about these attacks is crucial for implementing controls to protect organizations from supply chain attacks.

**IDEAS (continued)**
• Critical vulnerabilities were found in GI up actions, Microsoft, PyTorch, TensorFlow, and more.
• Bug bounty triage teams handled some reports well and applied solid mitigations to products.
• Everyone needs to learn about these attacks to protect their organization from compromise.
• CICD platforms can be used to escalate privileges and reach objectives.

**IDEAS (continued)**
• The importance of awareness in preventing supply chain attacks cannot be overstated.
• Internal cicd security is a critical concern that requires attention.
• Red team engagements can use cicd platforms to gain access and compromise systems.
• Learning about these attacks is essential for protecting against compromise.

**INSIGHTS**
• Supply chain attacks are becoming increasingly common and devastatingly effective.
• Internal cicd security is a critical vulnerability that must be addressed.
• Lack of awareness is the main issue in preventing supply chain attacks.
• Red team engagements can use cicd platforms to gain access and escalate privileges.
• Learning about these attacks is essential for protecting against compromise.

**QUOTES**
• "Learn about this stuff and don't let this be you."
• "Internal cicd security is a nightmare, almost not every red team engagement I've been on but a lot of red team engagements were able to get access to a cicd platform and then escalate privileges and use it to reach objective."
• "What we need everyone to do is go learn about these attacks to protect your or from compromise."

**HABITS**
• No specific habits mentioned.

**FACTS**
• No specific facts mentioned.

**REFERENCES**
• No specific references mentioned.

**ONE-SENTENCE TAKEAWAY**
Learn about supply chain attacks and internal cicd security to protect against compromise.

**RECOMMENDATIONS**
• Implement controls to prevent supply chain attacks based on awareness of the attacks.
• Learn about the vulnerabilities in high-end technologies and platforms to protect your organization.
• Address internal cicd security concerns to prevent compromise.
• Use bug bounty submissions to identify critical vulnerabilities.
