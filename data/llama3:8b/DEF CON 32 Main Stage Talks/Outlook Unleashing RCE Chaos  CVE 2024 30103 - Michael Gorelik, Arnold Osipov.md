**SUMMARY**
A presentation about NLM authentication and its vulnerability, presented by someone at Devcon, discussing recommendations for improvement.

**IDEAS**
• The sender's trustworthiness affects whether an image is automatically downloaded or previewed.
• Compromised credentials can lead to unauthorized access to network resources.
• Windows 11 introduces updates that prevent NLM authentication by default.
• Enabling S&B signing and managing outbound SMB communications are recommended best practices.
• Backward compatibility may hinder the effectiveness of these updates.

**INSIGHTS**

• The importance of staying informed about security updates and best practices.

**QUOTES**
• "Microsoft basically writes a lot about some of the recommendations obviously."
• "There are definitely additional recommendations uh that can follow."
• "We will be waiting here behind at the entry door for like 10 minutes."

**HABITS**
• There is no specific habit mentioned by the speaker.
• However, the recommendation to stay informed about security updates and best practices implies a habit of continuous learning.

**FACTS**
• Windows 11 introduces updates that prevent NLM authentication by default.
• Compromised credentials can be used within an organization to access network resources.

**REFERENCES**
• None mentioned specifically in the input.

**ONE-SENTENCE TAKEAWAY**
