**SUMMARY**
AB presents on IoT and IPC tunneling, discussing malware and firewalls.

**IDEAS:**
• AB connects to their server using an IPC tunnel.
• The first devices might cost something, but costs decrease gradually for thousands of devices.
• Mobile phone malware might not communicate over Wi-Fi or VPN.
• Malware can detect if it's being run over Wi-Fi or VPN and avoid doing so.
• Advanced malware might improve at detecting these environments.
• AB suggests that some malware might be misconfigured to allow traffic over Wi-Fi.

**INSIGHTS:**
• IoT devices can be connected using an IPC tunnel for security.
• Firewalls can be used to secure IoT devices.
• Malware detection and avoidance of certain environments are important considerations.
• Misconfigured malware can lead to security issues.
• Advanced malware might become more sophisticated in detecting secure environments.

**QUOTES:**
• "You can connect the IPC tunnel to your existing firewall..."
• "The mobile phone malare infections they might not communicate at all over Wi-Fi or VPN..."

**HABITS:**
• No specific habits mentioned by AB.

**FACTS:**
• No specific facts about the greater world mentioned by AB.

**REFERENCES:**
• No specific writing, art, tools, projects, or sources of inspiration mentioned by AB.

**ONE-SENTENCE TAKEAWAY**
• Connect IoT devices securely using an IPC tunnel and firewall to avoid malware detection.

**RECOMMENDATIONS:**
• Use an IPC tunnel to connect IoT devices for security.
• Configure firewalls to secure IoT devices.
• Monitor IoT device traffic for potential malware detection.
