**SUMMARY**
Martin and he H for cash poisoning discuss disabling key normalization, using a tool to detect discrepancies between normalization and limiters, and exploiting web cache poisoning and deception.

**IDEAS:**
• Using discrepancy in wild to exploit ER different servers
• Web cache poisoning and deception can be used in many cases
• Limiters being used in many systems can be exploited
• Tool provided to detect discrepancies between normalization and limiters
• Exploiting vulnerabilities for better payments in bounties

**INSIGHTS:**
• Disabling key normalization can lead to exploitation of different servers
• Web cache poisoning and deception can be used to identify discrepancies
• Limiters being used in many systems highlight potential vulnerabilities
• Tool detection can help identify exploitation opportunities
• Better payment can be achieved by exploiting vulnerabilities

**QUOTES:**
"Welcome to Track Two Talk number two on Saturday uh this morning we uh have Martin and he H for cash poisoning well we can try to AO to disable the key normalization in some cases it's possible in some cases not so in those cases I suggest using the tool that I will provide that will let you know if there's any discrepancy between normalization and the limiters..."
