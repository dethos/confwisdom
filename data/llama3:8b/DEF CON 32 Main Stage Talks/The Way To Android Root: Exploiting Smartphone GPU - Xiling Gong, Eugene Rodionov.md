**SUMMARY**
Shin, manager of C SCS, discusses concurrent code and GPU security in mobile space, suggesting mitigations and discussing the importance of performance and backward compatibility.

**IDEAS:**
• Concurrent code is not straightforward due to problems with reproducing and identifying vulnerabilities.
• GPU is attractive because it's widely accessible and can directly open the driver, making arbitrary data transmission possible.
• Untrusted code can be a major problem in Android's use of IPC and binder for component isolation.
• Moving GPU from in-process Hull to out-of-process HI may mitigate some problems.
• Using memory-safe languages in the driver could also help.
• Integer overflows and race conditions are potential issues.
• Performance is important for GPU, but it may impact backward compatibility.

**INSIGHTS:**
• The challenges of concurrent code can be addressed through careful consideration of performance and backward compatibility.
• The wide accessibility of GPU makes it a target for exploitation.
• Android's use of IPC and binder can be vulnerable to untrusted code.
• Memory-safe languages in the driver could help mitigate vulnerabilities.

**QUOTES:**
• "Why question mark because well I guess suggested mitigations in for GPU is is really not straightforward..."

**HABITS:**
• None mentioned

**FACTS:**
• Android uses IPC and binder for component isolation.
• The wide accessibility of GPU makes it a target for exploitation.

**REFERENCES:**
• Android
• Google.com (for publishing security research)

**ONE-SENTENCE TAKEAWAY**
The challenges of concurrent code in mobile space require careful consideration of performance, backward compatibility, and memory safety.

**RECOMMENDATIONS:**
• Implement memory-safe languages in the driver.
• Consider moving GPU from in-process Hull to out-of-process HI.
• Ensure careful consideration of performance and backward compatibility when addressing vulnerabilities.
