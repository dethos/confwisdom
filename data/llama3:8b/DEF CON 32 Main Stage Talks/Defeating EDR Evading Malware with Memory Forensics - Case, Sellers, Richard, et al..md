Here is the extracted information in Markdown format:

**SUMMARY**
A presentation on bypassing EDRLs (Enhanced Data Rate for Loans) by setting a breakpoint on Amsi's Scan Buffer, allowing malicious PowerShell code to be executed. The presenter introduces Patchus Amsi, a project that documents and detects ways to bypass EDRLs.

**IDEAS:**
• Amsi's Vector exception Handler can be bypassed using userland techniques.
• Breaking points can be set on the Scan Buffer to allow malicious code execution.
• Patchus Amsi is a project that documents and detects EDRL bypass methods.
• The presenter has written a 19-page white paper on this topic, available on the Defcon website.

**INSIGHTS:**
• Understanding how EDRLs are bypassed is crucial for detecting malicious code.
• Userland techniques can be used to evade Amsi's scanning mechanisms.
• Patching Amsi's Vector exception Handler and Scan Buffer can prevent malicious code execution.
• Continuous research and development of EDRL bypass detection tools are necessary.

**QUOTES:**
"Thank you for coming to the talk."

**HABITS:**
• None mentioned in this input.

**FACTS:**
• 40 references were used in the research effort.

**REFERENCES:**
• The presenter's email address can be obtained by contacting them.
• The Defcon website has the white paper and presentation slides available.

**ONE-SENTENCE TAKEAWAY:**
Understand how EDRLs are bypassed to prevent malicious code execution.

**RECOMMENDATIONS:**
• Read the white paper and references for a detailed understanding of EDRL bypass methods.
• Use Patchus Amsi to detect EDRL bypass attempts.
