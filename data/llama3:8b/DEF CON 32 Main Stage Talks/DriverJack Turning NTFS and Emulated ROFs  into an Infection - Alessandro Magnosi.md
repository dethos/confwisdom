Here is the extracted information in Markdown format:

**SUMMARY**
A speaker discusses detecting and preventing a specific type of exploit attack on Windows systems. The content focuses on Intel K vs Intel BT, disabling code integrity, and monitoring for drive letter changes and object manager modifications.

**IDEAS**
• Disable code integrity to prevent escalation of privileges
• Monitor for drive letter changes to detect exploitation attempts
• Check for Global links in the object manager for potential exploits
• Keep hardware up-to-date to mitigate exploit opportunities
• Implement a cross-check on driver load events using file lists and paths
• Use the ashes present during driver load events as a detection mechanism

**INSIGHTS**
• Exploiting VES to system or trusted installer can bypass traditional detection methods
• Large pages may not be abused for exploitation due to current limitations
• Disabling code integrity is a viable temporary solution for preventing escalation of privileges
• Monitoring for drive letter changes and object manager modifications can detect potential exploits

**QUOTES**
• "Disable code integrity and ask for a reboot"
• "Monitor for Drive letter change to just prevent this trick from bypassing detection"

**HABITS**
• None mentioned in the input content

**FACTS**
• Modern CPUs make it more difficult to exploit certain types of bugs
• Some exploits can be prevented by keeping hardware up-to-date

**REFERENCES**
• Pox driver Jack (publicly available)
• Windows operating system and its security features

**ONE-SENTENCE TAKEAWAY**
Disable code integrity and monitor for drive letter changes and object manager modifications to prevent escalation of privileges.

**RECOMMENDATIONS**
• Implement a cross-check on driver load events using file lists and paths
• Keep hardware up-to-date to mitigate exploit opportunities
• Monitor for Global links in the object manager for potential exploits
• Disable code integrity as a temporary solution for preventing escalation of privileges
