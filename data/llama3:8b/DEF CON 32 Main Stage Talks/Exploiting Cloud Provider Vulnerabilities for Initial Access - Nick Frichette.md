**SUMMARY**
Nick Forette presents on exploiting AWS service sets and discusses a condition key that limits what AWS account is permitted to assume a role, successfully blocking external adversaries. The talk also touches on the importance of defense in depth and auditing RLE (role) set use.

**IDEAS:**
• A condition key can be used to limit what AWS account is permitted to assume a role.
• This blocks external adversaries from assuming roles in your account.
• The condition key stays the same over time, making it a static layer of protection.
• Defense in depth is crucial to prevent attacks that exploit misconfigurations.
• Auditing RLE set use can help identify and fix potential vulnerabilities.

**INSIGHTS:**
• The importance of defense in depth when using cloud services like AWS.
• How condition keys can be used as an additional layer of security.
• The need for auditing RLE set use to prevent attacks that exploit misconfigurations.
• The value of a static layer of protection, like the condition key, in preventing attacks.

**QUOTES:**
• "we were able to actually test setting that condition key and it did successfully block an external adversary"
• "from a defense in depth perspective if pel says under absolutely no circumstance should someone be able to assume a role cross tenant"

**HABITS:**
• None mentioned

**FACTS:**
• AWS made the same mistake twice with AUMR (AWS User Migration Request) and Web Identity.

**ONE-SENTENCE TAKEAWAY**
The use of condition keys can be a powerful additional layer of security to prevent attacks that exploit misconfigurations in AWS role sets.

**RECOMMENDATIONS:**
• Use condition keys as an additional layer of security when using AWS role sets.
• Audit RLE set use regularly to identify and fix potential vulnerabilities.
• Prioritize defense in depth when implementing cloud services like AWS.
