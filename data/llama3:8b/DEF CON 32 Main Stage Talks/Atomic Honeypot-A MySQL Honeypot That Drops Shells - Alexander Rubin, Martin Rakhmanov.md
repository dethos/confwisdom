**SUMMARY**
A presentation about command injection attacks on MySQL databases, where the speaker demonstrates a vulnerability and shares their experience.

**IDEAS**

* Command injection attacks can be executed through fake database schema names.
* Creating a classical command injection attack can result in receiving data from the target database.
* The evil code used in this attack is a Python script that connects to the database to brute-force passwords and execute commands.
* There are multiple places where command injections can be executed, making it essential to fix vulnerabilities quickly.
* Setting up a MySQL database server with no password allows for easy exploitation of command injection attacks.

**INSIGHTS**

* Command injection attacks can be devastating if not properly secured.
* Vulnerabilities in databases can lead to significant data breaches and loss of trust.
* It is crucial to stay aware of potential threats and take proactive measures to prevent them.
* The demonstration of this attack highlights the importance of security and vigilance.

**QUOTES**

* "This will be fixed shortly so you need to try it right now if you want to see what it looks like."
* "You don't even need a tool, you can start a MySQL database server any version, create a route with no password."

**HABITS**

* No specific habits are mentioned in this content.

**FACTS**

* No specific facts about the greater world were mentioned in this content.

**REFERENCES**
