**SUMMARY**
Arjin Arjin Chakraborti presents on FAIR (Finding and Aligning Relevant) data for AI model training, discussing challenges and solutions.

**IDEAS:**
* The presentation focuses on finding and aligning relevant data for AI model training.
* Arjin uses an output parser through Lang chain to deal with incorrect YAML files generated by the LLT.
* One-shot prompting is used to generate data based on a map of the world or existing data.
* Providing specific examples can help the model generate data better.
* The presentation mentions the challenges and solutions for using LLTs for generating data.
* FAIR data is essential for AI model training, but it requires careful planning and execution.
* Arjin's team uses Lang chain to force the LLT to generate data in a specific format.
* Syntactically invalid YAML files can cause issues during data generation.
* Arjin shares their experience using oneshot prompting with examples to generate data.
* The presentation highlights the importance of data alignment and relevance for AI model training.

**INSIGHTS:**
* FAIR data is critical for AI model training, but it requires careful planning and execution.
* Using LLTs for generating data can be challenging, but providing specific examples can help.
* Syntactically invalid YAML files can cause issues during data generation, requiring parsing or formatting solutions.
* Arjin's team uses Lang chain to force the LLT to generate data in a specific format, highlighting the importance of output parsers.
* One-shot prompting with examples can be an effective way to generate data for AI model training.

**QUOTES:**
* "We do have a so I was using an output parser through Lang chain which was dealing with the issue of incorrect yaml file yaml that was being generated."
* "Yeah so yeah so there is uh parsing or or the ability of the llm to generate uh data in the format that you want it to is is a pain at least in my experience"

**HABITS:**
* Use oneshot prompting with examples for generating data.
* Provide specific examples to help the LLT generate better data.
* Use output parsers like Lang chain to deal with syntactically invalid YAML files.

**FACTS:**
* Syntactically invalid YAML files can cause issues during data generation.
* Arjin's team uses Lang chain to force the LLT to generate data in a specific format.

**REFERENCES:**
* Lang chain

**ONE-SENTENCE TAKEAWAY**
FAIR data is essential for AI model training, requiring careful planning and execution to ensure alignment and relevance.

**RECOMMENDATIONS:**
* Use FAIR data principles for AI model training.
* Provide specific examples to help LLTs generate better data.
* Use output parsers like Lang chain to deal with syntactically invalid YAML files.
* One-shot prompting with examples can be an effective way to generate data.
