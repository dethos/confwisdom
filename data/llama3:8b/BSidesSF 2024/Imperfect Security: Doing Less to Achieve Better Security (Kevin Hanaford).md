**SUMMARY**
Kevin presents on imperfect security, discussing how to make less bad decisions and focus on achieving goals. He shares a personal experience of choosing Amazon's managed Kubernetes instead of rolling out their own instance.

**IDEAS:**
* Design for humans, not computers, as attackers are human and take advantage of humans more often than not.
* Focus on what you're trying to get out of something and work backwards from there.

* It's essential to understand business objectives and how your actions impact them.
* Designing for humans requires empathy and understanding where people are.

**QUOTES:**
