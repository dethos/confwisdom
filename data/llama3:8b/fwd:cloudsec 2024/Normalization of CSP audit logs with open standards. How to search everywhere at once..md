**SUMMARY**
Jake presents on Prism Cloud's unmapped fields and standardization for security data. He discusses challenges, tips, and tricks for normalization, and mentions semantic layers and security data fabrics.

**IDEAS**
• Companies sponsoring Prism Cloud may have unmapped fields that require mapping.
• Standards can be Forked when released with mapped data.
• Compatibility issues arise when upgrading to new standards.
• Data loss occurs when normalization is done at the source or in the pipeline.
• Keeping raw data and creating views allows access to both normalized and raw data.
• Multiple teams may have different strategies for data storage and access.

**INSIGHTS**
• Standardization challenges exist due to unmapped fields and compatibility issues.
• Normalization requires careful consideration of data loss and context preservation.
• Semantic layers can provide a framework for standardized data.
• Security data fabrics are emerging as a solution for complex data integration.
• Data normalization must balance standardization with raw data preservation.

**QUOTES**
• "Before I introduce the next speaker, uh quick word from one of our sponsors Prism Cloud is the in the standards one of the things that I've observed is like we tag things as IP addresses or maybe even Source IP addresses yeah but there's a difference between X forwarded for Source IP Source IP at the network layer and ever how do you I guess think about where we should do that do we need to keep both the Source data and normalized data in order to to resolve those kinds of things some companies do some companies want to and they will um so that's why it's again where are you doing the normalization you lose that if you get it at the source potentially or in the pipeline um if you keep the raw data and you're just creating views on it then you get to keep the raw data a lot of my customers that I talk to it's not one team it's multiple teams so that's their strategy keep keep it raw somewhere but access it through through a normalized if that's what you need"

**ONE-SENTENCE TAKEAWAY**
Prism Cloud's unmapped fields require careful standardization to balance data loss with context preservation.

**RECOMMENDATIONS**
• Develop a strategy for mapping and normalizing unmapped fields in Prism Cloud.
• Consider keeping raw data and creating views on it to preserve context.
• Evaluate the benefits and drawbacks of normalization at different stages.
