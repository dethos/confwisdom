**SUMMARY**
Zach GCK presents on container analysis scanning and vulnerability CVEs, discussing initial compromises and data sets from cloud providers.

**IDEAS:**
• Zach's project involves working with artifact registry and container analysis scanning Pub subs.
• He uses mitm dump with a python add-on for proxying requests.
• The code is brittle due to handling entropy in request fields.
• Scalability issues arise from accounting for various use cases.
• Zach looks into other middle proxies, but burp Suite might not work for this purpose.
• Cipher and Memograph have limitations in storing complex objects with nested JSON data.

**INSIGHTS:**
• Container analysis scanning is crucial for identifying vulnerabilities.
• Initial compromises can be tracked through cloud provider data sets.
• Proxies like mitm dump help manipulate requests, but require careful handling.
• Scalability issues arise from accommodating various use cases and request fields.
• Cipher and Memograph have limitations in storing complex objects with nested JSON data.

**ONE-SENTENCE TAKEAWAY:**
Container analysis scanning is crucial for identifying vulnerabilities in cloud provider data sets.

**RECOMMENDATIONS:**
• Conduct regular container scans to identify vulnerabilities.
• Utilize proxies like mitm dump for request manipulation, but be aware of scalability limitations.
• Explore other middle proxies, such as burp Suite, for potential use cases.
