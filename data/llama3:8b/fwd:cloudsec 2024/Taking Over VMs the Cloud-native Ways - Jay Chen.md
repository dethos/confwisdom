**SUMMARY**
Speaker: unknown
Content: VM security and cloud APIs

**IDEAS:**
• Periso Permiso requires public key replication to every VM.
• Cloud API allows users to push public keys into VMs without logging in.
• Instant Connect agent pulls new public keys from the cloud and modifies SD config files.
• Principle needs instant connect send H-key permission and target VM needs write permission.
• Direct Code Execution allows remote code execution in cloud environments.

• SSM Run Command can allow direct code execution with permission and SMM agent installation.
• AWS requires additional configuration and permissions for Direct Code Execution.
• GCP requires Always Config to be installed on the VM and enabled in metadata service.
• There is a unique way to SSH into a VM in AWS without open inbound ports.

**INSIGHTS:**
• Cloud APIs simplify VM security by replicating public keys.
• Instant Connect agent streamlines authentication and authorization processes.
• Direct Code Execution enables remote code execution in cloud environments with proper permissions.
• AWS, GCP, and other cloud providers offer varying levels of support for direct code execution.
• SSH into a VM without open inbound ports is a unique feature in AWS.

**QUOTES:**
• "I want to thank our sponsor Periso Permiso..."
• "...the principal need the instant connect send H-key permission..."
• "...direct code execution essentially allow remote code execution..."

**HABITS:**
• None mentioned

**FACTS:**
• Cloud APIs can simplify VM security.
• AWS and GCP offer varying levels of support for direct code execution.

**REFERENCES:**
• Periso Permiso
• Cloud API
• Instant Connect agent
• SSM Run Command
• Always Config

**ONE-SENTENCE TAKEAWAY**
Cloud APIs enable secure remote access to VMs while streamlining authentication and authorization processes.

**RECOMMENDATIONS:**
• Use cloud APIs for secure remote access to VMs.
• Replicate public keys using Periso Permiso.
• Enable instant connect send H-key permission for secure authentication.
