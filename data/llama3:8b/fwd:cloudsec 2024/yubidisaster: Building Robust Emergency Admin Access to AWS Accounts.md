**SUMMARY**
Fusion o Fusion o presents on customer authentication and authorization platform, discussing disaster recovery exercise and shifting responsibility to AWS or cloud service provider.

**IDEAS:**
* The customer authentication and authorization platform makes developers' lives awesome.
* Disaster Recovery exercise brings down one core piece of infrastructure to bring it back up quickly in case of failure.
* Shifting responsibility to AWS or cloud service provider ensures that the account is not compromised.
* The platform controls access to AWS accounts using IAM roles.
* Root CA is used for auditing and detecting compromises.
* A detection and response team is necessary for investigating potential breaches.
* Daily usage of the platform should be discouraged due to noise and complexity.

**INSIGHTS:**
* Shifting responsibility to a cloud service provider can provide strong security guarantees.
* Disaster Recovery exercises are essential for testing and improving incident responses.
* The platform provides orthogonal functionality to normal authentication mechanisms.
* A detection and response team is crucial for investigating and responding to potential breaches.
* Daily usage of the platform should be discouraged due to noise and complexity.

**QUOTES:**
* "Once the AWS account is compromised, you can't really recover from that."
* "We use this to control access to our AWS accounts so it's all if those are owned then you know all the stuff in them is already owned."

**HABITS:**
* Regularly conduct disaster recovery exercises to test and improve incident responses.
* Use a detection and response team to investigate potential breaches.
* Discourage daily usage of the platform due to noise and complexity.

**FACTS:**
* AWS provides strong security guarantees for its accounts.
* Root CA is used for auditing and detecting compromises.
* IAM roles are used for controlling access to AWS accounts.

**ONE-SENTENCE TAKEAWAY**
Shifting responsibility to a cloud service provider can provide strong security guarantees, but it's essential to regularly conduct disaster recovery exercises and use a detection and response team to investigate potential breaches.

**RECOMMENDATIONS:**
* Use a customer authentication and authorization platform for secure access control.
* Regularly conduct disaster recovery exercises to test and improve incident responses.
* Shift responsibility to a cloud service provider for strong security guarantees.
