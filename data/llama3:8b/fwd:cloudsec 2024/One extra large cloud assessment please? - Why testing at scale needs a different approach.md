**SUMMARY**
Mohit and Christian's talk on Breakout 2: They discussed the importance of taking a top-down approach to security testing, focusing on finding impactful findings that affect the broader business, rather than just achieving 100% coverage of individual teams' components.

**IDEAS**

* Taking a top-down approach to security testing allows for more objective-driven testing and focuses on the entire estate rather than specific components.
* Focusing on impactful findings helps improve the overall security posture of environments.
* The approach is useful for reducing testing time while still achieving meaningful results.
* It provides a different perspective when looking at applications individually, finding connections that wouldn't normally be found.
* The method allows for more efficient use of resources and less time spent on individual components.

**INSIGHTS**

* Taking a top-down approach to security testing prioritizes impactful findings over 100% coverage of individual teams' components.
* Focusing on the entire estate rather than specific components leads to better results and improved overall security posture.
* The method streamlines testing, reducing time spent on individual components and increasing efficiency.
* It encourages a more comprehensive view of applications and their connections.

**QUOTES**
