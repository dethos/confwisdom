Here is the output in Markdown format:

**SUMMARY**
Natalia Sova presents "Don't Water Your AI Security Framework of Course" on using large language models (LLMs) for security and compliance, discussing the importance of training employees to use LLMs correctly.

**IDEAS**
* The talk discusses the use of LLMs in AI security frameworks and emphasizes the need for proper training.
* Natalia shares a personal experience where she was blocked by several banks due to AI-generated fraud alerts.
* The speaker highlights the potential pitfalls of using LLMs, including summarizing information without capturing important details.
* She suggests that ISO standards are universal but can be tailored to specific industries or domains.
* Natalia notes that some standards are tailored specifically to generative models (gen) and image/video generation.

**INSIGHTS**
* AI-generated summaries may miss important details if not properly trained on relevant data.
* Proper training is crucial for accurate AI decision-making in security frameworks.
* ISO standards can be universal but may require adaptation for specific use cases.
* Gen models are useful for summarizing information, but human oversight is necessary for complex decisions.

**QUOTES**
* "I wouldn't trust it 100%... I would trust it to summarize some kind of meeting or webinar on the topic."
* "Lots of prompt engineering because AI gen tends to summarize everything quite neatly on first sight."

**HABITS**
* None mentioned in this input.

**FACTS**
* Samsung stopped using AI for a while due to concerns about IP leaks.
* Cloud Security Alliance is working on foundational documents for AI security frameworks.
* Mastercard uses LLMs for fraud alerts and notifications.

**REFERENCES**
* None mentioned in this input.

**ONE-SENTENCE TAKEAWAY**
Use large language models responsibly by providing proper training and oversight to ensure accurate decision-making.

**RECOMMENDATIONS**
* Use generative models carefully, considering the potential limitations of AI-generated summaries.
* Ensure prompt engineering is used to fine-tune AI models for specific use cases.
* Develop human oversight processes to review AI-generated decisions.
