**SUMMARY**
A speaker discusses their presentation "From Intrusion to Insight: Lessons Learned" and shares insights on using Cloud billing APIs for anomaly detection, mentioning Indonesia as a source of hacking activity. They also mention the importance of setting reasonable detection thresholds and averages from past spending.

**IDEAS:**
* The speaker often gets engaged when things go wrong, rather than when they go well.
* Setting reasonable detection thresholds is key to avoiding false positives in Cloud billing APIs.
* Averaging last 12 months' spend across AWS accounts gives an idea of normal spend and helps set detection thresholds.
* Bali, Indonesia is a great place, but the speaker's theory on hacking activity there remains unknown.
* The speaker would love to work with everyone and share data or indicators if possible.
* Cloud billing APIs and thread Intel are not a great match at this moment in time.

**INSIGHTS:**
* It is crucial to set reasonable detection thresholds when using Cloud billing APIs for anomaly detection.
* Averaging past spending can help avoid false positives in Cloud billing API detection.
* Sometimes, getting engaged only occurs when things go wrong rather than when they go well.

**QUOTES:**
"I don't know why but um so but to answer the billing part what we do or what we advise is look at the averages from I don't know last 12 months across your WS accounts you get at least an idea of what you normal spend is and then you set it a bit higher than that so that you don't get too many false positives that's a very pragmatic approach to it I think um so that's how I would advise that point yeah"

**HABITS:**
* Set reasonable detection thresholds using averages from past spending.

**FACTS:**
* Indonesia is a source of hacking activity, according to the speaker.
* Bali, Indonesia is a great place, but the speaker's theory on hacking activity there remains unknown.

**REFERENCES:**
* None mentioned in this presentation.

**ONE-SENTENCE TAKEAWAY:**
To effectively use Cloud billing APIs for anomaly detection, set reasonable detection thresholds using averages from past spending to avoid false positives.

**RECOMMENDATIONS:**
* Set reasonable detection thresholds using averages from past spending to avoid false positives.
* Averaging last 12 months' spend across AWS accounts gives an idea of normal spend and helps set detection thresholds.
