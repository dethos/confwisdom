**SUMMARY**
A presentation on a honeypot setup for detecting and preventing attacks. The presenter discusses their experience setting up a VM with inlace scripts, reviewing logs, and analyzing activity.

**IDEAS:**
• The honeypot was set up to detect and prevent attacks by creating an AWS account with restricted resources.
• The use of service control policies limited the actions an attacker could take, even with administrator access.
• The presenter suggests using a file versioning system to snapshot changes in containers for further analysis.
• Automation can be used to create GitHub users and fake organizations.
• The Purple Urchin tool automates GitHub and goes through all that stuff.

**INSIGHTS:**
• The importance of monitoring capability in setting up honeypots to detect attacks.
• Service control policies can limit an attacker's actions, even with administrator access.
• Automation can be used to create and manage fake organizations on GitHub.
• Honeypots can help prevent attacks by detecting and responding to suspicious activity.

**QUOTES:**
• "Do you have any thoughts on creating honeypots like this for customers?"
• "We're not releasing this for customers because it does take quite a bit of monitoring capability..."
• "There's one thing... please meet with me afterwards I can tell you we're using service control policies to limit the actions inside..."

**HABITS:**
• No specific habits mentioned by the presenter.

**FACTS:**
• No specific facts mentioned in the presentation.

**REFERENCES:**
• Purple Urchin tool

**ONE-SENTENCE TAKEAWAY**
The use of honeypots and service control policies can help detect and prevent attacks, even with limited resources.

**RECOMMENDATIONS:**
• Use automation to create and manage fake organizations on GitHub.
• Implement file versioning systems to snapshot changes in containers for further analysis.
• Consider using Purple Urchin tool to automate GitHub activities.
