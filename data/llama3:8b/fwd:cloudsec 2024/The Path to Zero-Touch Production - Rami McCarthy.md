**SUMMARY**
Ford CloudSec Day 2: Ramy discusses zero touch production, machine learning, and malicious shell access.

**IDEAS**
* Zero touch prod is a North star but not a goal.
* Building full-proof systems is not feasible or necessary.
* Machine learning can predict and prevent malicious shell access, but it's not the only solution.
* Intentional productive activity can be misinterpreted as malicious by security systems.
* Senior engineers are indistinguishable from adversaries in their production environment activities.
* Security should focus on making safe paved roads rather than trying to detect malice.

**INSIGHTS**
* Predicting and preventing malicious shell access is not the ultimate goal.
* Zero touch prod is a guiding principle, but not a guarantee of security.
* Building robust systems can be overkill and unnecessary.
* Machine learning can help identify potential issues, but human judgment is still necessary.

**QUOTES**
* "I don't think building like full outlined system is a thing I would blanket recommend to any profile of company..."
* "Like there's no type of company where I'd say this is how you must do things..."

**HABITS**
* None mentioned in the input.

**FACTS**
* No specific facts were mentioned in the input.

**REFERENCES**
* None mentioned in the input.

**ONE-SENTENCE TAKEAWAY**
Ramy emphasizes the importance of making safe paved roads in security, rather than relying on predicting and preventing malicious shell access.

**RECOMMENDATIONS**
* Focus on building robust systems that prioritize safety over security.
* Implement machine learning to identify potential issues, but do not rely solely on it.
* Make intentional productive activity possible while minimizing risk.
