Here is the extracted information in Markdown format:

**SUMMARY**
Good morning everyone welcome back to Ballroom 2... discussing a threat actor's actions, including imitating an identity provider and logging, with a question about using AWS services like KMS for encryption.

**IDEAS**
* Cloud native attackers know what they're targeting and doing.
* The attack was not sophisticated, except for mimicking the identity provider.
* Threat actors may prioritize data over encryption for ransom demands.
* In-cloud environments can be easier to recover from attacks.

**INSIGHTS**
* Attackers' sophistication level depends on their actions and goals.
* Cloud-based attacks can be less damaging than in-premise ones.
* Ransom demands are more common than data encryption.
* Attackers may prioritize data theft over encryption for ransom purposes.

**QUOTES**
* "We don't know enough about them here to come to any sweeping conclusions."
* "These guys really cared about not being caught within the moment they knew what they were doing."

**HABITS**
* None mentioned in this content.

**FACTS**
* Rare cloud-based attacks with KMS encryption are seen.
* In-cloud environments can have immutable backups.
* Ransom demands are more prevalent than data encryption.

**REFERENCES**
* None mentioned in this content.

**ONE-SENTENCE TAKEAWAY**
Cloud-based attacks, while potentially damaging, may be less sophisticated and prioritize data theft over encryption for ransom purposes.

**RECOMMENDATIONS**
* Implement robust logging and monitoring to detect anomalies.
* Prioritize data backup and immutable storage options.
* Educate users on cloud security best practices.
