**SUMMARY**
A speaker discusses their experience researching and documenting Azure APIs using the OpenAPI specification. They share their approach, challenges, and plans for maintaining the documentation as new services are released.

**IDEAS:**
* The speaker's job is not done; more research is needed to understand cloud provider attack surfaces.
* Cloud providers present a limited view of their attack surfaces; holistic analysis is required for effective threat detection.
* Azure APIs are currently documented, but Microsoft Graph FD SDKs and others are autogenerated from the specification.
* The OpenAPI specification can be used as input for code generation tools or Postman collections.
* Scaler is a tool used to automatically generate the documentation site.

**INSIGHTS:**
* Cloud providers' attack surfaces are not fully understood; more research is needed to improve threat detection.
* Documentation of Azure APIs and SDKs is ongoing, with plans to release new services and maintain existing ones.
* The OpenAPI specification provides a foundation for understanding cloud provider APIs and generating code.
* Holistic analysis is crucial for effective threat detection against cloud provider APIs.

**QUOTES:**
* "We need to stop assuming the uh the cloud providers attack surfaces as they presented it to us."
* "I wrote the spec by hand pretty much now I did a bit of automation but mostly around just uh grapping out the operations Etc."

**HABITS:**
* No specific habits mentioned by the speaker.

**FACTS:**
* No specific facts mentioned by the speaker.

**REFERENCES:**
* Scaler (tool used to automatically generate the documentation site)
* AutorRest (Microsoft-built tool for generating SDKs)

**ONE-SENTENCE TAKEAWAY**
Cloud providers' attack surfaces require holistic analysis and ongoing research to improve threat detection.

**RECOMMENDATIONS:**
* Conduct holistic analysis of cloud provider APIs to improve threat detection.
* Continuously update and maintain documentation as new services are released.
* Utilize the OpenAPI specification for code generation or Postman collections.
