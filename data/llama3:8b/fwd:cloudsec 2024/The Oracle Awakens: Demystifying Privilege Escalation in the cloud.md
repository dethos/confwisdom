**SUMMARY**
Lucas is presenting on privilege escalation methods in Oracle Cloud. He discusses techniques to grant oneself more privileges, including modifying group membership and creating API keys for other users.

**IDEAS:**
• Natural language approach makes policies easy to read and write but difficult to parse.
• OCI default permissions are secure by design, requiring someone to make a mistake or developers not making mistakes to exploit.
• Minimize the "manage groups" permission to administrators only.
• Oracle does not provide a second layer of defense against privilege escalation.

**INSIGHTS:**
• The ease of policy creation can be a security risk if not properly managed.
• Default permissions are designed to be secure, but still require caution and monitoring.
• Minimizing privileges is key to preventing privilege escalation attacks.
• Natural language policies can be difficult to parse, requiring specialized tools.

**QUOTES:**
• "You have to rely on someone making a mistake or your developers not making mistakes if you're on the blue team."
• "It's pretty hellish when you have to use a natural language parser."

**HABITS:**

**FACTS:**
• OCI default permissions are designed to be secure by design.

**ONE-SENTENCE TAKEAWAY**
Prevent privilege escalation attacks by minimizing privileges and monitoring for unusual activity.

**RECOMMENDATIONS:**
• Implement a second layer of defense against privilege escalation.
• Monitor user activity closely for suspicious behavior.
• Minimize the "manage groups" permission to administrators only.
