**SUMMARY**
Meg Ashby discusses tagging and Lambda functions in VPCs, exploring ways to control tags and monitor VPC usage.

**IDEAS**
* Tagging is a loose control mechanism that can be circumvented
* Using IAC or Terraform can help implement tagging policies
* Automation can be used to watch for changes in resources and enforce tagging
* Resource State change monitoring can be used to track VPC activity
* Congestion pricing on a PVPC basis could be implemented, but it's not straightforward

**INSIGHTS**
* Tagging is an important control mechanism, but it's not foolproof
* Automation can help with resource management and enforcement of tagging policies
* Monitoring VPC usage and tracking changes in resources is crucial for security
* Congestion pricing on a PVPC basis could be a viable solution for managing network traffic

**QUOTES**
* "Tagging is a loose control mechanism that's pretty much any way that it's implemented"
* "I personally wouldn't necessarily suggest doing that [on the account level]"
* "You could use like VPC flow logs if you really care to look into elastic network interfaces and do that sort of parsing"

**HABITS**
* None mentioned in the content

**FACTS**
* PVPCs are not data plan components
* Elastic Network Interfaces can be used for monitoring VPC traffic
* AWS Network Firewall can be used for egress monitoring

**REFERENCES**
* Terraform
* IAC (Infrastructure as Code)

**ONE-SENTENCE TAKEAWAY**
Enforce tagging policies through automation and resource state change monitoring to ensure secure VPC usage.

**RECOMMENDATIONS**
* Implement automated tagging using IAC or Terraform
* Use resource State change monitoring to track VPC activity
* Monitor VPC flow logs for elastic network interface parsing
* Consider congestion pricing on a PVPC basis for managing network traffic
