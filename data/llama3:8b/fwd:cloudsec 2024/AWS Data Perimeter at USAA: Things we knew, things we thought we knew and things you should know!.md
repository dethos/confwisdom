**SUMMARY**
Tyler Warren and Caleb McDonald discuss managing VPC endpoints and prioritizing alerts for security teams. They share their approach to centralizing policies, using automation, and investing engineering capacity effectively.

**IDEAS:**
• Prioritize high-risk alerts for security teams
• Centralize VPC endpoint policies using automation
• Invest engineering capacity in areas that provide the highest return on investment
• Use tools like Access Analyzer to simplify resource policy management
• Implement a combination of preventative, detective, and corrective measures
• Restrict access based on trust zones and API actions
• Be flexible with access restrictions depending on environment and use cases

**INSIGHTS:**
• Centralizing policies can improve efficiency and reduce errors
• Automation can help streamline processes and reduce manual intervention
• Investing in engineering capacity is crucial for achieving high returns on investment
• Prioritizing high-risk alerts can help security teams respond quickly to threats
• Implementing a combination of preventative, detective, and corrective measures can provide comprehensive protection

**QUOTES:**
• "We try to be as restrictive as we can but if we find it's a non-restricted environment...we'll tend to open it up more."
• "Analyzing resource policies at scale is hard."

**HABITS:**
• Prioritize high-risk alerts and respond quickly
• Invest engineering capacity in areas that provide the highest return on investment
• Implement automation to streamline processes
• Restrict access based on trust zones and API actions

**FACTS:**
• VPC endpoints can be managed centrally using policies and automation
• Access Analyzer can simplify resource policy management at scale
• Investing in engineering capacity is crucial for achieving high returns on investment

**REFERENCES:**
