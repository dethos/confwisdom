**SUMMARY**
Ian presenting on "Freeing Identity from Infrastructure" about automating virtual cloud IM in a multi-account, multi-cloud environment using Vault.

**IDEAS:**
• Automating identity management frees up resources for more important tasks.
• Using Vault to manage credentials simplifies infrastructure management.
• Registering Kubernetes namespaces centrally ensures namespace uniqueness and prevents collisions.
• Frameworks can be applied to control which name spaces run in certain environments.
• Vault providers are not necessarily behind an interface, making it difficult to swap out.
• Internal APIs can be used for credential management instead of Vault.

**INSIGHTS:**
• Identity management can be a bottleneck in cloud infrastructure automation.
• Centralized registration of Kubernetes namespaces ensures namespace uniqueness and prevents collisions.
• Frameworks can help control which name spaces run in certain environments.
• Vault providers are not necessarily behind an interface, making it difficult to swap out.
• Internal APIs can be used for credential management instead of Vault.

**QUOTES:**
• "We do a similar thing with kubernetes name spaces so we register them centrally..."
• "Maybe people run hundreds or thousands of AWS accounts and you sort of give a team an AWS account and say within some reason I don't really care what you do in here..."

**HABITS:**
• None mentioned

**FACTS:**
• None mentioned

**REFERENCES:**
• Vault
• Kubernetes

**ONE-SENTENCE TAKEAWAY**
Automating identity management with Vault can simplify infrastructure management and free up resources.

**RECOMMENDATIONS:**
• Use centralized registration for Kubernetes namespaces to ensure uniqueness and prevent collisions.
• Apply frameworks to control which name spaces run in certain environments.
• Consider using internal APIs for credential management instead of Vault.
