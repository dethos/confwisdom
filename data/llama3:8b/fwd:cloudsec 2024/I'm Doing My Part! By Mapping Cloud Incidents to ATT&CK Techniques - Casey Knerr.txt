**SUMMARY**
Ford Cloud SE 2024 session: discussing cloud-specific attack techniques and working groups. Casey presents, focusing on improving attack techniques and contributing to Mitre.

**IDEAS:**
• The best way to contribute to improve cloud-specific attack techniques is through working groups and email communication.
• Starting with hybrid environment (on-prem and Cloud) requires considering overlapping attack techniques between both environments.
• New techniques can be added to Mitre even if there's no public blog, as long as evidence of its use in the wild exists.

**INSIGHTS:**
• Focusing on improving cloud-specific attack techniques through working groups and email communication.
• Hybrid environment (on-prem and Cloud) requires considering overlapping attack techniques between both environments.
• Evidence of a technique's use in the wild is enough to add it to Mitre, even if there's no public blog.

**QUOTES:**
• "I guess we need something that's like publicly citable that describes it"
• "If you have evidence that it's been used in the wild then tell us and we don't like that isn't acceptable"

**HABITS:**
• Regularly monitoring email for contributions and feedback.

**FACTS:**
• Mitre accepts new attack techniques even if there's no public blog, as long as evidence of its use in the wild exists.
• Evidence of a technique's use in the wild is crucial in adding it to Mitre.

**REFERENCES:**
• None mentioned

**ONE-SENTENCE TAKEAWAY**
To improve cloud-specific attack techniques, contribute through working groups and email communication, focusing on hybrid environment overlap.

**RECOMMENDATIONS:**
• Contribute to improving cloud-specific attack techniques through working groups.
• Regularly monitor email for contributions and feedback.
• Consider overlapping attack techniques between hybrid environments (on-prem and Cloud).
• Submit new techniques to Mitre with evidence of its use in the wild.
