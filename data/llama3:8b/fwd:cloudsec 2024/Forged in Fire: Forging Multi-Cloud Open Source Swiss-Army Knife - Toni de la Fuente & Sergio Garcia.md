**SUMMARY**
Tony and Sergio present a session on AWS security tools, discussing compliance, benchmarks, and remediations. They highlight the importance of consistency, simplicity, and flexibility in their tools and share insights on using the Apache License.

**IDEAS:**
* Consolidate package installation with BP Brew containers to simplify usage statistics.
* Telemetry is not effective for security tools; use PIP stats instead.
* The Apache License allows community growth and standardization.
* Scout Suite hasn't been maintained recently, making Prowler a better option.
* Simpler installation is better than installing multiple modules.
* Consistency over years is crucial for building trust in compliance tools.
* Remediations should be flexible to accommodate different user preferences.
* Cloud asset API can retrieve global resources and enable feature checks.
* Hardening controls may not expose all necessary settings, requiring workarounds.
* Prowler can cover CIS benchmarks for multiple cloud providers.

**INSIGHTS:**
* Consistency is key in building trust with compliance tools.
* Simplicity and flexibility are essential in tool design.
* Community growth and standardization facilitate information sharing.
* Remediations should be flexible to accommodate different user preferences.
* Cloud asset API can streamline resource management.
* Hardening controls may not expose all necessary settings, requiring workarounds.

**QUOTES:**
* "Actually it's changing that over the last year they have changed a lot."
* "Following the their own sdks is easier for python but in some of our checks we had to go directly through the API through the rest API."

**HABITS:**
* Regularly maintain and update security tools.
* Prioritize simplicity and flexibility in tool design.

**FACTS:**
* Cloud asset API can retrieve global resources.
* Scout Suite hasn't been maintained recently.

**REFERENCES:**
* Apache License
* Prowler
* BP Brew containers

**ONE-SENTENCE TAKEAWAY**
Consistency, simplicity, and flexibility are essential for building trust in compliance tools and streamlining security processes.

**RECOMMENDATIONS:**
* Use consolidated package installation with BP Brew containers.
* Prioritize simplicity and flexibility in tool design.
* Regularly maintain and update security tools to ensure consistency.
* Utilize cloud asset API for streamlined resource management.
* Consider alternative options like Prowler when Scout Suite is not maintained.
