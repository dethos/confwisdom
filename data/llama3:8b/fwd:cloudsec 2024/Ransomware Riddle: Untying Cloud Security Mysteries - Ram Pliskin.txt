SUMMARY:
A presentation on ransomware, cloud security, and graph modeling by an unknown speaker. The content discusses the challenges of modeling and intimacy level required to extract the right artifacts for creating new edges in a resource graph built for an application or cloud application.

IDEAS:

* Modeling is a serious challenge in getting sustainable approach
* Intimacy level with resources is required to extract right artifacts
* Graphs are important for defenders, but asset inventory is big
* CSPM solutions focus on cloud and take asset inventory as input
* MFA can be a property on an account or other version
* Graph evolving with additional layers like activities or network topology

INSIGHTS:

* CSPM has limited its boundary to Cloud, but attacks start from non-cloud environments
* Understanding exposure management is crucial for graph modeling
* Intimacy level with resources is required for extracting right artifacts
* MFA can be a property on an account or other version
* Graph evolving with additional layers like activities or network topology

QUOTES:

* "There are tons of items that need to be considered in order to get the modeling right"
* "Graph allows us to see transitive uh characteristic"

HABITS:

* No habits mentioned by the speaker

FACTS:

* No facts mentioned by the speaker

REFERENCES:

* None mentioned by the speaker

ONE-SENTENCE TAKEAWAY:
To achieve graph modeling, intimacy level with resources is crucial for extracting right artifacts.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

* To create a sustainable approach to modeling, consider the challenges and requirements
* Intimacy level with resources is necessary for extracting right artifacts
* CSPM solutions focus on cloud, but attacks start from non-cloud environments
