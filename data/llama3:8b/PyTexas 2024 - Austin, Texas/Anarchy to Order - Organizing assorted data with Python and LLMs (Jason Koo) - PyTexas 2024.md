**SUMMARY**
Jason Coupland, a Developer Advocate for Neo4j, discusses graph databases and how they can be used to avoid LLM hallucinations. He shares best practices for building knowledge graphs and avoiding common pitfalls.

**IDEAS**

* A graph database stores relationships between pieces of data.
* Independent embeddings in a vector database are not linked.
* Adding metadata to each embedding does not create relationships between them.
* Graph databases can be thought of as a 3D space with dense connections.
* Using text-to-SQL or text-to-Cipher modules can shield the LLM from directly interacting with the database.
* It's essential to think about your data model when building a graph database.

**INSIGHTS**

* Graph databases can be used to represent complex relationships between entities.
* The lack of relationships between embeddings in a vector database makes it less efficient than a graph database.
* Shielding the LLM from directly interacting with the database helps prevent hallucinations.
* A data model for a graph database should be thought through at first, even if it's not perfect.

**QUOTES**

* "You want to have the relationships use words that are very common and make sense."
* "Don't use relationship names that are very complicated and if you have very complex paths between two entities..."

**HABITS**

* Simplify things for a graph database.
* Think about your data model first, even if it's not perfect.
* Use text-to-SQL or text-to-Cipher modules to shield the LLM.

**FACTS**

* Graph databases can be used to represent complex relationships between entities.
* The lack of relationships between embeddings in a vector database makes it less efficient than a graph database.
* Shielding the LLM from directly interacting with the database helps prevent hallucinations.

**REFERENCES**

* None mentioned

**ONE-SENTENCE TAKEAWAY**
Graph databases are powerful tools for representing complex relationships between entities, and can be used to avoid LLM hallucinations by shielding the model from direct interaction with the data.

**RECOMMENDATIONS**

* Use text-to-SQL or text-to-Cipher modules to shield the LLM.
* Think about your data model first, even if it's not perfect.
* Simplify things for a graph database.
