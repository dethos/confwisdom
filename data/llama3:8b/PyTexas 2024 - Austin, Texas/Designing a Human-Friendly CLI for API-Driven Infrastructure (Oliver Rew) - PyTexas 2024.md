**SUMMARY**

Alvaro, a software engineer at Bloomberg in New York City, presents on improving command-line interfaces (CLI) for internal products. He shares his experience using Fast API and Infra CLI to create a new CLI endpoint with a CSV flag and proposes adding a tab-separated value (TSV) flag.

**IDEAS**

* Improve CLI behavior without changing C code
* Use a single PR to update the API codebase and automatically generate a new CLI
* Implement autoc CLI as open-source
* Create a mock API, Meal API, for testing and interacting with meal ideas

**INSIGHTS**

* The best way to create a good CLI is by building it around APIs that are designed for humans, not just machines
* Having a single source of truth for the CLI behavior makes updates easier and more efficient
* Autoc CLI can be used as an open-source project, allowing others to contribute and reuse

**QUOTES**

* "We didn't really make this tool for automation. Our hope was that like, programmatic users would use it."
* "It's just a matter of time before we open source it under my company."

**HABITS**

* Practice writing clear and concise summaries
* Encourage continuous improvement by implementing changes quickly

**FACTS**

* None mentioned in the input

**REFERENCES**

* Infra CLI
* Fast API

**ONE-SENTENCE TAKEAWAY**

Create a good CLI by building it around APIs that are designed for humans, not just machines.

**RECOMMENDATIONS**

* Use autoc CLI as an open-source project to encourage contributions and reuse
* Implement continuous improvement by making changes quickly
* Create a single source of truth for the CLI behavior to make updates easier and more efficient
