**SUMMARY**
Josh Schneider presents on plugins, discussing the benefits of using a main class to define plugin behavior and limits. He also explores ways to control plugin loading through CLI parameters and regex patterns.

**IDEAS:**
• Using a main class to define plugin hierarchy and limits can simplify plugin development.
• Defining methods for events in the main class ensures only those methods are called on events.
• The main class can limit what plugins do by defining their signatures.
• Using CLI parameters, you can control which paths to search for plugins and exclude specific modules or plugin names.
• Regex patterns can be used to ignore modules or plugin names that match certain patterns.
• Unit testing is essential to ensure plugin functionality works correctly.

**INSIGHTS:**
• The main class serves as a central hub for defining plugin behavior and limits.
• Defining event methods in the main class provides a clear boundary for plugin interaction.
• Controlling plugin loading through CLI parameters or regex patterns enhances flexibility and customization.
• Unit testing is crucial to verify plugin functionality and ensure it works as expected.

**QUOTES:**
• "I'm gonna do my best not to suck cuz I'm the only class uh um hierarchy and all that stuff..."
• "...if I Define what methods are going to be called on events then only those methods are going to be called on events..."

**ONE-SENTENCE TAKEAWAY:**
The main class plays a crucial role in defining plugin behavior, limits, and interactions, enabling better control and customization.

**RECOMMENDATIONS:**
• Use the main class to define plugin hierarchy and limits.
• Employ regex patterns or CLI parameters to control plugin loading.
• Prioritize unit testing to ensure plugin functionality works correctly.
