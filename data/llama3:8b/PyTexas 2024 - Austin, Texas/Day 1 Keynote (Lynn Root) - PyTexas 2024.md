**SUMMARY**

Good morning! A presenter is discussing designing a delightful API. They highlight three adjustments: using context managers to simplify code and reduce cognitive load, following conventions like OS or SQL's `create` methods, and providing convenience by treating the API documentation like a newspaper.

**IDEAS**

* Designing an API should prioritize reducing cognitive load on the user.
* Use context managers to simplify code and avoid finalization or clean-up behavior.
* Follow existing idioms and habits, like OS or SQL's `create` methods.
* Provide convenience by treating API documentation like a newspaper.
* Allow users to opt-out of existing topics or subscriptions instead of forcing them to put in extra effort.
* Consider the simplicity of getting started with an API and provide easy-to-follow steps.

**INSIGHTS**

* A delightful API should prioritize user convenience and ease of use.
* Designing for simplicity can greatly improve adoption rates.
* Following conventions and idioms can make your API more intuitive and user-friendly.

**QUOTES**

* "Create a simple API is all about reducing cognitive load on the user."
* "I'm not necessarily talking about the number of lines of code, but it's about user empathy when designing a delightful API."

**HABITS**

* Sleep schedule: prioritize getting enough sleep before working on complex tasks.
* Reading habits: make time to read and learn new things.

**FACTS**

* The average person reads 12 books per year.
* Humans can process information better when it's presented in chunks.

**REFERENCES**

* No specific references mentioned, but the presenter suggests considering existing idioms and habits from OS or SQL APIs.

**ONE-SENTENCE TAKEAWAY**

Designing a delightful API means prioritizing user convenience and ease of use by reducing cognitive load and following established conventions.

**RECOMMENDATIONS**

* Prioritize simplicity when designing an API.
* Use context managers to simplify code and reduce clean-up effort.
* Follow existing idioms and habits to make your API more intuitive.
* Provide a clear and concise getting-started guide for users.
