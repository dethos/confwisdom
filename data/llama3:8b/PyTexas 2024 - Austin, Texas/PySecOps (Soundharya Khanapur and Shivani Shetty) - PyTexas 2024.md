Here is the extracted information in Markdown format:

**SUMMARY**
Shivani and a colleague presented on web application security vulnerabilities. They discussed common issues, such as using free certifications that may not be valid, and the importance of testing code before releasing it to a testing team.

**IDEAS**
* Make sure to use a valid certification for your web application.
* Test your code thoroughly before releasing it to a testing team.
* Use software like Snot to analyze potential vulnerabilities.
* Ensure all employees know how to implement security measures, such as input validation.
* Consider the trade-off between user experience and security when developing a web application.
* Always remember that no software is completely secure.
* Use third-party libraries with caution, ensuring they are secure and properly configured.

**INSIGHTS**
* The ease of use for a system often correlates with its level of insecurity.
* Compromising on security can lead to user experience sacrifices.
* No single solution exists for web application security; a layered approach is necessary.
* Regularly updating certifications and testing code can help prevent vulnerabilities.
* Implementing security measures upfront can save time and resources in the long run.

**QUOTES**
* "All security is a compromise between the ease of use and the security."
* "You can't trust any software; there will always be data breaches."

**HABITS**
* Create and regularly update certifications for your web application.
* Implement input validation to prevent common vulnerabilities.
* Use third-party libraries with caution, ensuring they are secure and properly configured.

**FACTS**
* There is no single solution for web application security; a layered approach is necessary.
* Regularly updating certifications can help prevent vulnerabilities.
* Testing code thoroughly before releasing it to a testing team is crucial.

**REFERENCES**
* Snot software
* Third-party libraries

**ONE-SENTENCE TAKEAWAY**
Prioritize the security of your web application by implementing layers of protection and regularly testing and updating your code.

**RECOMMENDATIONS**
* Use valid certifications for your web application.
* Implement input validation to prevent common vulnerabilities.
* Regularly update certifications and test code to ensure security.
* Prioritize user experience while balancing security concerns.
* Use third-party libraries with caution, ensuring they are secure and properly configured.
