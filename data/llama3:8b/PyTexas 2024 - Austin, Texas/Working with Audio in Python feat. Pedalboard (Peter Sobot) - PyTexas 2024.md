**SUMMARY**
Peter from Spotify presents on Pedalboard, an open-source audio processing library. He discusses its features, usage, and design process.

**IDEAS:**
• Pedalboard can render audio files to a buffer or network stream.
• The API is designed to be Pythonic and familiar to users who know Python.
• The library allows for down-sampling, but not up-sampling, as there's no additional detail added to the sound.
• FFM Peg is not used internally; instead, Pedalboard is compiled code with no external dependencies.

**INSIGHTS:**
• Audio processing libraries like Pedalboard can be powerful tools for developers and musicians alike.
• Designing APIs that are Pythonic and easy to use can lead to increased adoption and user satisfaction.
• The choice between using Pedalboard or traditional DAWs (digital audio workstations) depends on specific needs and goals.

**QUOTES:**
• "You can render to a buffer or renter to a network stream, doesn't matter, it's all available right there in your audio file."
• "Pedalboard is much more scriptable and much more easy to get uh integrated into your own software."
