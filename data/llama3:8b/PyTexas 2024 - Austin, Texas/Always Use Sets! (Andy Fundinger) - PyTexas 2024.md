**SUMMARY**
A presentation on memory profiling and set usage in Python. The speaker discusses their experience using sets and frozen sets for building a snowman, and shares insights on handling non-determinism of set ordering across runs. They also talk about excluding lists and real-world use cases.

**IDEAS:**
• Memory profiling is important for identifying performance bottlenecks.
• Frozen sets are useful for constructing sets when immutability is desired.
• Sets have a noise level difference in performance compared to frozen sets.
• Excluding lists can be used to skip certain machines or tests.
• Real-world use cases include testing multiple machines and skipping special cases.
• Python's ability to handle set comparisons can be leveraged for non-deterministic set ordering.

**INSIGHTS:**
• Memory profiling helps identify performance bottlenecks, allowing for optimization.
• Frozen sets provide a way to ensure immutability of set constructions.
• Sets can have varying performance characteristics depending on the use case.
• Excluding lists can simplify testing and reduce errors.
• Real-world use cases often require adapting code for specific scenarios.

**QUOTES:**
• "I took them apart and put them back together." (on handling immutable tuples)
• "Prob in MO either avoid having it be important this usually comes up in your test cases."
• "Yeah yeah yeah uh so constructing the Frozen set is 7,000 NS and constructing the set is 6,000..."
• "I had to let it go..."

**HABITS:**
• No specific habits mentioned by the speaker.

**FACTS:**
• No specific facts mentioned by the speaker.

**REFERENCES:**

**ONE-SENTENCE TAKEAWAY**
Memory profiling and set usage are crucial for optimizing performance in Python, especially when working with real-world use cases.

**RECOMMENDATIONS:**
• Use memory profiling to identify performance bottlenecks.
• Consider using frozen sets for immutability needs.
• Optimize set constructions based on the specific use case.
• Adapt code for specific scenarios in real-world use cases.
