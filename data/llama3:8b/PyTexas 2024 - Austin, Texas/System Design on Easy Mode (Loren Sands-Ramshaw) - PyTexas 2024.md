**SUMMARY**
Lauren talks about system design on easy mode, discussing durable execution and its trade-offs, including latency, and how it can be used in non-real-time critical systems.

**IDEAS:**
* Durable execution can be achieved by deploying a separate worker that only takes new production function executions.
* Another way to achieve durable execution is through an if-then statement depending on the current version.
* The trade-off for durable execution is higher latency, which might not be suitable for real-time gaming.
* Durable execution can be used in non-real-time critical systems like air and spacecraft support systems.
* High latency might make durable execution unsuitable for single-digit milliseconds precision.
* System design should include a mechanism to watch over workers to prevent malfunctioning.
* The system should only trust the database and not the workers, with timeouts for tasks that take too long.

**INSIGHTS:**
* Durable execution can be achieved through separate workers or if-then statements.
* Latency is the main trade-off for durable execution.
* High latency might make durable execution unsuitable for real-time systems.
* Non-real-time critical systems like air and spacecraft support systems can use durable execution.
* System design should prioritize watching over workers to prevent malfunctioning.

**QUOTES:**
* "Deploy a separate worker that only takes the new version of the code."
* "Another way is to have an if-then statement depending on what, like if current version is one, do this logic otherwise do some other logic."

**ONE-SENTENCE TAKEAWAY**
Durable execution can be achieved through separate workers or if-then statements, but with a trade-off of higher latency.

**RECOMMENDATIONS:**
* Use durable execution for non-real-time critical systems.
* Prioritize watching over workers to prevent malfunctioning.
* Consider using timeouts for tasks that take too long.
