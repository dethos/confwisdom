Here is the extracted information in Markdown format:

**SUMMARY**
Andy presenting on Docker and its use cases. Discussion includes tracking build time metrics, using Docker ignore file, and choosing between Python Bookworm and Bullseye.

**IDEAS:**
* Use `time` functionality in bash to track image build times.
* Create a cache of built images to speed up future builds.
* Utilize Docker's `run --cache` feature for faster dependency resolution.
* Employ Docker ignore file to exclude unwanted files from the build process.
* Choose Python Bookworm as the most stable version, considering its LTS status.
* Use Ry or UV to speed up package manager operations and reduce footprint.

**INSIGHTS:**
* Measuring image build times can help optimize the development workflow.
* A well-organized Docker ignore file can significantly improve build performance.
* Choosing the right Python version can have a significant impact on project stability.
* New tooling like Ry or UV can greatly accelerate package manager operations.

**QUOTES:**
* "I do really and I started this practice because otherwise it can get out of hand."
* "There is a Time functionality in uh like in bash so you can use time and then build the image..."
* "It's all just kind of manually in in your okay uh any features of Docker that you find not being used as often as they should..."

**HABITS:**
* Use `time` to track image build times.
* Employ a cache of built images for faster future builds.
* Utilize Docker ignore file to exclude unwanted files from the build process.

**FACTS:**
* Docker's `run --cache` feature can greatly accelerate dependency resolution.
* Python Bookworm is considered one of the most stable versions, with its LTS status.
* Ry or UV tooling can significantly speed up package manager operations and reduce footprint.

**REFERENCES:**
* None mentioned in this input

**ONE-SENTENCE TAKEAWAY**
Use Docker's features to optimize your development workflow and improve build times.

**RECOMMENDATIONS:**
* Track image build times using `time` functionality.
* Utilize a cache of built images for faster future builds.
* Employ Docker ignore file to exclude unwanted files from the build process.
* Choose the right Python version based on stability requirements.
