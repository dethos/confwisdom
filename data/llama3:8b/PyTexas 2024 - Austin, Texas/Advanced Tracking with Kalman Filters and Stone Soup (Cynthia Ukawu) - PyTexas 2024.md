**SUMMARY**
Sin presents on solving tracking problems using constant acceleration instead of constant velocity. The talk covers creating a tracker and plotting changes in the data over time, highlighting the Stone Soup framework and its versatility.

**IDEAS:**

* Use Stone Soup for tracking problems
* Constant acceleration can be used instead of constant velocity
* Create a tracker using common filters
* Plot changes in the data over time
* Explore different models to find the best fit for your data
* Use unscented common filters and other statistical properties
* Consider alternative frameworks like Piie Filter
* Read notes from Tony Lacy's chapter 11 tutorial

**INSIGHTS:**

* Constant acceleration can be a more effective approach than constant velocity in certain tracking scenarios
* The Stone Soup framework offers a versatile solution for tracking problems, allowing for the use of various filters and data types
* Exploring different models and finding the best fit for your data is crucial for effective tracking

**QUOTES:**

* "I tried using this thing that existed, it didn't do what I wanted, so I just built my own."
* "Imagine you're trying to track a bad guy in an airplane."
